# Space-platform-Game
This is my first Unity game project that I have built during my third year in Brunel University for my Computer Science course.

### Project Goal

The goal of this project was to create a space game platformer with incremental levels, one of which should be the boss level.  

#### MVP

* The project must have a minimum of three levels
* A range of sounds must be used throughout the game
* Animation for multiple objects
* Use of the particle system
* The difficulty level should be incremental



#### Game Description

> Jump and shoot to kill enemies and avoid traps in order to reach the end of each level. Use the boost and the friendly sealed spike in the last level to kill the boss and its minions to retrieve the rocket. 



#### Game Story

> The game is about an astronaut who was sent on a mission, he is now on his way back to Earth after completing it. Because the mission took longer than expected he must now swap rockets on a planet where the replacement rocket is kept. Unfortunately the rocket was taken by a monster and he now has to find and defeat the monster to get it back 



#### Target Audience

> The target audience for this game are space gamers, users from age 10-12. The reason is because the game is pretty simple with just a few traps. Players below the age of 10 may find the game a bit more complicated, and any older than 12 will possibly find the game too boring and easy.
